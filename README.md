# Langton's Ant

A program that simulates Langton's Ant.

## Gameplay

Squares on a grid are colored either black or white and one square is arbitrarily identified as the "ant". For each step the ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions according to these rules:
```
At a white square, turn 90° clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
```
```
At a black square, turn 90° counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
```
